Tradelink
=========

[q] why this thing is here?
[a] cause I love Tradelink the way it was before Glean. And the fact of existence 
    of this "legacy Tradelink" snapshot wont interfere with the plans of its real owners
    to change direction. After all it is a free world.

       File: src-pure.rev3754.07-Aug-2013.before-pracplay-crippled-tradelink
Description: Tradelink svn revision 3754 which was committed on 07-Aug-2013
             On 18-Sep-2013 whole svn repo was "flattened" (no more history available) 
             and commiter Joshua Franta put the following comment: "removing sensitive 
             passwords/sensitive info", but PracPlay also deleted ASP, Kadina, Quotopia.
             They basically crippled the whole idea of free open source Tradelink 
             without anouncing their plans. They could do this in some more community
             friendly way, but what was done is done. Anyways - they have created this 
             brillian project, so it is up to them what to do with it. 
             No complains.
             This latest revision r3754 still has ASP, Kadina, Quotopia etc. 
             It also has "trunc" along with some recent development brunches.

Description: a bit more details on the recent history of Tradelink development.
             If you read it carefully and see who put all the efforts and how much
             time was dedicated to The Tradelink, then you'd have even less complains :)
             Thank you Josh, that was titanic effort!
